# Java-RMI-Example
Java RMI example created for a college test.

This project has two different programs: the server and the client.
The client sends an interval to the server, which returns the amount of even, odd, prime, composite and perfect numbers inside that interval to the client.

# How to run
Run rmiregistry.exe on a terminal
Run ServidorMain.java to start the server up
Edit, in ClienteMain.java, the interval which you wanna check the numbers in between
Run ClienteMain.java.
